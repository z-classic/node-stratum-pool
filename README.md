High performance Stratum poolserver for equihash in Node.js. One instance of this software can startup and manage multiple coin
pools, each with their own daemon and stratum port :)

#### Notice
This is a module for Node.js that will do nothing on its own. Unless you're a Node.js developer who would like to
handle stratum authentication and raw share data then this module will not be of use to you. For a full featured portal
that uses this module, see [Z-NOMP (Z Node Open Mining Portal)](https://github.com/z-classic/z-nomp). It
handles payments, website front-end, database layer, mutli-coin/pool support, auto-switching miners between coins/pools,
etc.. The portal also has an [MPOS](https://github.com/MPOS/php-mpos) compatibility mode so that the it can function as
a drop-in-replacement for [python-stratum-mining](https://github.com/Crypto-Expert/stratum-mining).


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zone117x/node-stratum-pool.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zone117x/node-stratum-pool)

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/stratum-pool.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/stratum-pool/)

#### Why
This server was built to be more efficient and easier to setup, maintain and scale than existing stratum poolservers
which are written in python. Compared to the spaghetti state of the latest
[stratum-mining python server](https://github.com/Crypto-Expert/stratum-mining/), this software should also have a
lower barrier to entry for other developers to fork and add features or fix bugs.


Features
----------------------------------
* Daemon RPC interface
* Stratum TCP socket server
* Block template / job manager
* P2P to get block notifications as peer node
* Optimized generation transaction building
* Connecting to multiple daemons for redundancy
* Process share submissions
* Session managing for purging DDoS/flood initiated zombie workers
* Auto ban IPs that are flooding with invalid shares
* __POW__ (proof-of-work) & __POS__ (proof-of-stake) support
* Transaction messages support
* Vardiff (variable difficulty / share limiter)
* When started with a coin deamon that hasn't finished syncing to the network it shows the blockchain download progress and initializes once synced

#### Hashing algorithms supported:
* ✓ __Equihash__ (Zclassic, Zcash)

Requirements
------------
* node v7+
* coin daemon (preferably one with a relatively updated API and not some crapcoin :p)


Example Usage
-------------

#### Install as a node module by cloning repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/z-classic/node-stratum-pool node_modules/stratum-pool
npm update
```

#### Module usage

Create the configuration for your coin:

Possible options for `algorithm`: *equihash*.

```javascript
var myCoin = {
    "name": "Dogecoin",
    "symbol": "DOGE",
    "algorithm": "scrypt",
    "nValue": 1024, //optional - defaults to 1024
    "rValue": 1, //optional - defaults to 1
    "txMessages": false, //optional - defaults to false,

    /* Magic value only required for setting up p2p block notifications. It is found in the daemon
       source code as the pchMessageStart variable.
       For example, litecoin mainnet magic: http://git.io/Bi8YFw
       And for litecoin testnet magic: http://git.io/NXBYJA */
     "peerMagic": "fbc0b6db" //optional
     "peerMagicTestnet": "fcc1b7dc" //optional
};
```

If you are an equihash coin that doesn't have any founder's rewards,

```javascript
var myCoin = {
    "name": "Zclassic",
    "symbol": "ZCL",
    "algorithm": "equihash",
};
```

If you are using an equihash coin that has founder's rewards, you need to include details about the FR system,
```javascript
var myCoin = {
    "name": "zcash_testnet",
    "symbol": "taz",
    "algorithm": "equihash",
